# Barcode Capture Simple Sample

This simple sample uses the camera to read a single barcode using the BarcodeCapture API.

Consider also the **pre-built component** designed for ergonomic high-speed single scanning available via the SparkScan API.

## Sample Barcodes

Once you get the sample up and running, go find some barcodes to scan. Don’t feel like getting up from your desk? Here’s a [handy pdf of barcodes](https://github.com/Scandit/.github/blob/main/images/PrintTheseBarcodes.pdf) you can print out.

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## How to run

Make sure SCANDIT_LICENSE_KEY is available in your environment, by either:

- running `SCANDIT_LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> npm run build`
- placing your license key in a `.env` file at the root of the sample directory
- or by inserting your license key into `index.ts`, replacing the placeholder `-- ENTER YOUR SCANDIT LICENSE KEY HERE --` with the key.

Build and serve the application:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

Open https://localhost:8888 and start scanning.

## How to test the sample from any device

The dev and preview servers run over HTTPS by default (using a self-signed certificate) and listen on every network interface, and they print a scannable QR code in the terminal when you run `npm run dev` or `npm run serve`. To test the sample on a phone or tablet on the same network:

1. Scan the QR code shown in the terminal (or open `https://<your-computer-ip>:8888` on the device manually).
2. Accept the self-signed certificate warning once.

The HTTPS context is what lets the browser grant camera access. To reach the sample from outside your network you can still expose it with a tool such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (`ngrok http 8888`) and use the HTTPS URL.

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open https://localhost:8888 and start scanning.
